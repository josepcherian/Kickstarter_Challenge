# Kickstarter Analysis Challenge
Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
1. For the purpose of data analysis, import the data into tables
2. Using filters and generate new columns
3. Generate a pivot table and line charts for more visualization
4. Perform and Interpret Excel Analysis with visualization

### Purpose
Part of the class assignmnets in the boot camp, perform a data analysis on the kickstarter excel sheet for a customer to determine the timings for her fundraising goal for a play

For the first deliverable , it was determine that launch dates and goal amounts were influences for the successful outcomes

For the second deliverable, we can see differnt outcomes based on different goals

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Data was filtered according to the theatres,number of outcomes were nominal and were filterd from the data set

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Because of different outcomes data was again filterd from the data set.Additional filter applied for the plays subcategory on behaf of customer request.Goals were divided into multiple groups,total number of successful, failed and canceled outcomes were calculated for each group and converted into percentages

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The percentage of canceled projects had all zeros, initialy thought that it happened due to calculation errors but later found that no canceled projects were there while applying the subcategory filter.The formulas were checked and verified multiple times.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The key months to launch a successful theater project are May and June afterwards declines through the end of the year
2. Very few cancelled theatre project

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful percentages of outcomes are projects with goals that are less than $5000 goals, between $30000 to $35000 and $45000 to $50000. 

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
No canceled theater projects and there were no examples of canceled plays in the subcategories

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. We could create a new field that counts the number of months or days between the launch and deadline dates and cross that with the number of outcomes, and then turn that into a marked line graph.  
2. line with markers chart could create if we have enough numbers of canceled projects while we sort the subcategory
